# Patterns Subdirectory in the Striver Handy Codes Repository

## Overview
This subdirectory contains a collection of C++ programs focused on generating various patterns. These programs are ideal for students who are learning loops, nested loops, and basic logic implementation in C++. Each program demonstrates a unique way to construct patterns using numbers, letters, or symbols, and is suitable for practice and understanding key programming concepts.

## Usage Notes
- These programs require a C++ compiler to execute. Use any IDE or terminal with a compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
- Input specifications are provided in the comments of each program.
- Modify the value of `n` as needed to explore different patterns.

---

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow consistent naming conventions when adding new pattern programs.
- Ensure that all programs include comments explaining the logic.
- Test your code with multiple inputs to verify its correctness.
